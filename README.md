Project Name
OAuth Client-Server Example

Description
This project provides an example implementation of an OAuth client-server interaction using Python. It demonstrates the process of obtaining an access token from an OAuth server and using it to request resources from a resource server. The code includes two main components:

Client Code: The client code interacts with the OAuth server to obtain an access token and then uses that token to request resources from the resource server.
OAuth Server Code: The OAuth server code handles the authentication process, including verifying the client, generating authorization codes, exchanging codes for access tokens, and validating access tokens.
Requirements
Python 3.x
flask package
requests package
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/repository.git
Install the required packages:

pip install flask requests
Configuration
Before running the code, you need to configure the client ID and client secret in both the client and OAuth server code. Replace the placeholder values (your_client_id and your_client_secret) with your actual client credentials.

Usage
Start the OAuth server:

python oauth_server.py
Start the resource server:

python resource_server.py
Run the client code:

python client.py
Follow the instructions in the client console to authorize and request resources.
